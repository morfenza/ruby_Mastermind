# Ruby Mastermind
Project: Mastermind, from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)

I created a Mastermind game using Ruby so you can play it versus the computer in the console!

## Links
- [Play the game on Replit! TBA]()
- [Link to the assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind)

## Notes
- Trying to create a better IA to play against!
- Needs the gem Colorize to work (I'll bundle it later)
